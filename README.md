Oi! Welcome to the **Relegation Simulator 2025/26**! 🏟️

Are you sweating buckets watching your team slide down the table? 😰 Or maybe you're just a neutral enjoying the chaos? 🍿 This tool lets you play Mystic Meg 🔮 and predict the run-in for the relegation scrap!

## 🎯 What's the Point?

The Premier League season is squeaky bum time! 🍑 This site focuses on the relegation battle involving **West Ham United**, **Leeds United**, **Tottenham Hotspur**, and **Nottingham Forest**. (Sorry Spurs fans, you're in the mud too! 😉).

## 🕹️ How It Works

You've got two ways to play the gaffer:

### 1. 📋 Fixture List Mode

- Scroll through the remaining fixtures for all teams.
- Click **W** (Win), **D** (Draw), or **L** (Loss) for each game.
- Watch the **Live Standings** update instantly! 📊
- Includes a **Fixture Difficulty Rating (FDR)** so you know if it's a walk in the park 🌳 or a trip to the Etihad 🏰.

### 2. 👆 Swipe Mode
For the Tinder generation!
- Focus on one game at a time.
- **Swipe Right** for a Win! 👉✅
- **Swipe Left** for a Loss! 👈❌
- **Swipe Up** for a Draw! 👆🤝

Big shout out to the open source wizardry that makes this tick:

## 🍴 Fork It like a Sunday Roast

Want to make this for your own relegation battle? Or maybe the title race? (We can dream, right? 🏆).

1.  **Fork this repo** 🍴
2.  Open `index.html`.
3.  Look for the `const teams` object in the `<script>` tag.
4.  Swap out the teams, points, and fixtures.
    ```javascript
    const teams = {
        'your-team': {
            name: 'Your Team FC',
            currentPoints: 40,
            currentGD: 5,
            fixtures: [ ... ]
        },
        // ... add more teams
    };
    ```
5.  Update the CSS variables in `:root` to match your team colours. 🎨
6.  Deploy to GitHub Pages and become the oracle! 🧙‍♂️
